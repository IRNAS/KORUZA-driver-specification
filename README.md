# KORUZA-driver
KORUZA driver is an open hardware open software development of a driver platform to be used in wireless optical system KORUZA for controlling motors, sensors, and other low-level peripherals. This repository currently serves as the ongoing requirements base for developing such a device.

## KORUZA-driver features

* 3x Unipolar Stepper motors
* Current measurement
* USB connection
* End switches
* Output for laser diode
* support for 3 encoders for closed-loop control in high-precision systems

## Base

The "reference" designs used for this specification are [UniversalUnipolarStepperController board](https://github.com/IRNAS/UniversalUnipolarStepperController) and [Universal-Stepper-Driver-Rpi Board](https://github.com/IRNAS/Universal-Stepper-Driver-Rpi) which are open hardware developed for previous Koruza system.

Requirements are a separate file and entries there are based on closing issues.
