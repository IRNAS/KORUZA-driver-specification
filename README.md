# KORUZA-driver
KORUZA driver is an open hardware open software development of a driver platform to be used in wireless optical system KORUZA for controling motors, sensors, and other low level periferials. This repository currently serves as the ongoing requirements base for developing such a device.

## KORUZA-driver features
* 3x Unipolar Stepper motors
* Current mesurment
* USB connection
* End switches
* Output for laser diode
* support for 3 encoders for closed-loop control in high-precision systems

## Base
The "reference" design used for this specification is [UniversalUnipolarStepperController board](https://github.com/IRNAS/UniversalUnipolarStepperController) and [Universal-Stepper-Driver-Rpi Board](https://github.com/IRNAS/Universal-Stepper-Driver-Rpi) which are open hardware developed for preveous Koruza system.

Requirements are a separate file and entries there are based on closing issues.
